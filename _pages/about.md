Hi! I’m Martin Bean, a software engineer based in Newcastle upon Tyne, UK. I enjoy creating elegant solutions to complex problems.

I have over a decade of experience, including nearly five years running my own freelance consultancy. I currently work for Pfizer as a technical lead in their platform team.

In my spare time, I run a business called Your Fight Site. As a teenager, I began building websites for independent professional wrestling promotions. I now build SaaS products for the professional wrestling, MMA, and boxing industries. Products include a self-service VOD platform and a multi-tenant CMS.

Day-to-day I work with technologies such as PHP, MySQL, Postgres, and Amazon Web Services. I also have lots of experience working with semantic, accessible, and SEO-friendly HTML; CSS (both with and without preprocessors); and JavaScript (including modern ES syntax, frameworks like Vue and React, and build tools such as Webpack). Other technology interests include Go, Swift, and Flutter. I’m also dabbling with BrightScript for Roku channel development.
