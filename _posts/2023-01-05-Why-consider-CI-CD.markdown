Continuous integration (CI) and continuous delivery (CD) are software development practices that aim to minimize the time between writing code and deploying it to production. They can help improve the quality of software by catching defects early in the development process and automatically building, testing, and deploying code changes.

Here are some benefits of using CI/CD:

Reduced lead time: By automating the build, test, and deployment process, you can reduce the time it takes to get code changes into the hands of users.
Improved code quality: CI/CD can help catch defects early in the development process, before they make it into production. This can save time and resources that would otherwise be spent on debugging and fixing issues in production.
Faster iteration: With CI/CD, developers can more easily and frequently deploy code changes, which can allow for faster iteration and experimentation.
Greater collaboration: CI/CD can help facilitate collaboration between developers by making it easier to merge code changes and deploy them to a shared environment.
Overall, CI/CD can help organizations deliver software faster, with higher quality, and with less effort.
