Looking back now to when I first starting writing code I have to be honest and say I found it to be a rather Vcan intimidating process that was also an exciting experience and rewarding process. Being able to write code is not a skill that is held by many. 

Looking to get started? - Here are some steps you can follow to get started:

Choose a programming language: There are many programming languages to choose from, each with their own strengths and uses. Some popular languages for beginners include Python, C++, and Java.

Install a development environment: A development environment is a piece of software that allows you to write, run, and debug your code. Some popular development environments include PyCharm, Visual Studio, and Eclipse.

Learn the basics: Once you have a development environment set up, you can start learning the basics of your chosen programming language. This might include things like data types, variables, loops, and functions.

Practice, practice, practice: The best way to get better at coding is to practice writing code. You can do this by working through online tutorials and exercises, or by trying to build small projects of your own.

Seek help when you need it: Don't be afraid to ask for help when you get stuck. There are many online resources and communities available to help you learn to code, such as forums, Stack Overflow, and online course.

When I think back to my own experience of learning to code my motivation was enchanced by the need to understand the idea of how websites were structured for live clients that had employed the local agency I was working for at the time. 

So my background initially saw me take the path of learning HTML/CSS & Basic Javascript (Effectively Front-end Dev requirements) which then later progressed into Backend Technologies and languages such Php, Ruby on Rails & Content Managed Solutions such as WordPress, Joomla & Drupal.

It has only been in recent years that I have decided to focus on languages & technologies such as Javascript & Ruby on Rails but as if that was obvious as This blog is coded in a Ruby format.

To summarise - writing and perfecting a code base takes time and dedication, so be patient with yourself and don't be too hard on yourself initially. There are plenty of resources to help you on your journey and the developer community is very friendly and always helpful.
